## Visualization
Once the aggregated data is available, we can proceed to read it and finally visual it using Zeppelin.

### Accessing Zeppelin UI
To visualize the aggregations first we need to to make the notebook accessible by executing the command bellow:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward zeppelin-server 8080:80
```

Zeppelin UI should be accessible using the url  ```http://localhost:8080```

### Importing Notebook
Import the file ```$(pwd)/jconf-2020/visualization/src/resources/notebook.json``` into Zeppelin.
